# # Lesson 10 - Bouncing Ball
import random
# ## Task 1: Even or Odd
# Create a function that takes in a number and returns whether it is even.

# 1. Create a function named ‘is_even()’
# 2. If the number is even, the function should return ‘True’
# 3. If the number is odd, the function should return ‘False’
# 4. Using the ‘is_even()’ function, loop through a list of numbers and print them out in this format:
# “3 is an odd number”
# “9 is an odd number”“2 is an even number”

# ## Task 2: Age Group
# Create a function that will take in someone’s age and return either of the following based on the age provided:
# - ‘Child’ (Below 13)
# - ‘Teen’ (14-20)
# - ‘Adult’ (21-64), or
# - ‘Senior’ (65 and above)

# Define the function ‘age_group()’ with one parameter: ‘age’.
# Use ‘if-elif-else’ statements to return the appropriate age group based on the ‘age’ parameter.

# ## Task 3: Quadruple the Number 
# Create a function that takes in a number and quadruples it.

# Create a function named quadruple_number() that takes in 1 parameter
# The function should take in a number, and return the quadrupled value of the number
# Using the quadruple_number() function, print the quadruples of the following numbers:
# - 105 (ans: 420)
# - 24 (ans: 96)
# - 402 (ans: 1608)
# - 594 (ans: 2376)

# ## Task 4: Sum of squares - Function within a function

# ### Task 4a
# Create a function ‘square()’ that will take in a number and return the squared value of the number. Squared is when the number is multiplied by itself.

# For example, “5 squared” or 5² = 5x5 = 25

# Example:
# square(5) >>> 25
# Square(7) >>> 49
# square(3) >>> 9

# ### Task 4b
# Create a function ‘sum_of_squares()’ that will take in 2 numbers and return the sum of each of the number squared.

# You must use the  ‘square()’ function within the ‘sum_of_squares()’ function.

# Example:
# sum_of_squares(3, 4) >>> 25
# sum_of_squares(2, 7) >>> 53
# sum_of_squares(9, 5) >>> 106

# ## Task 5: Creating a turtle window
# By creating and using the following function, create a turtle window that is 300(w) x 500(h):
# - setup_screen(screenWidth, screenHeight)

# You will require the following:
# 1. import turtle
# 2. turtle.Screen()
# 3. .setup(width=???, height=???)
# 4. return
# 5. ‘screenWidth’ variable
# 6. ‘screenHeight’ variable

# ## Task 6: Creating a turtle object
# By creating and using the following function, create a blue circular turtle object with its pen lifted: 
# - create_blue_ball()

# You will require the following:
# 1. turtle.Turtle()
# 2. .shape()
# 3. .color()
# 4. .penup()
# 5. return

# ## Task 7: Moving turtle object
# By creating and using the following function, move the turtle object by ‘dx’ and ‘dy’ in a forever loop: 
# - move_ball(ball, dx, dy)

# You will require the following:
# 1. .setx()
# 2. .xcor()
# 3. .sety()
# 4. .ycor()
# 5. ‘dx’ variable
# 6. ‘dy’ variable

# ## Task 8a: Detecting edge (x-axis)
# By creating and using the following function, reverse the x-direction that the turtle object is moving when it touches the left/right side of the window: 
# - check_x(ball, screenWidth)
# - Returns ‘True’ if ball is beyond window in the x-axis

# You will require the following:
# 1. .xcor()
# 2. screenWidth/2
# 3. or
# 4. -screenWidth/2
# 5. *= -1

# ## Task 8b: Detecting edge (y-axis)
# By creating and using the following function, reverse the y-direction that the turtle object is moving when it touches the top/bottom side of the window: 
# - check_y(ball, screenHeight)
# - Returns ‘True’ if ball is beyond window in the y-axis

# You will require the following:
# 1. .ycor()
# 2. screenHeight/2
# 3. or
# 4. -screenHeight/2
# 5. *= -1

# ## Challenge: Features to implement
# 1. Have a line trail that the turtle object leave behind as it bounces around
# 2. Change the following each time the turtle object bounces:
# - Colour of the turtle object
# - Speed of the turtle object (faster/slower)
# - Shape of the turtle object
# 3. Use a variable to count the number of times the ball has bounced
# 4. Exit the loop when the ball bounces 50 times.
# 5. Use the time library to keep the program running for ‘x’ seconds determined by the user
